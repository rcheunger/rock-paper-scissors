# rock-paper-scissors

Plan:
create simple game functions with buttons, add some UI after

Pseudocode:
- create buttons, define player, create getComputerChoice function using math.random, create playround function that takes player selection, computerselection, create text that changes when win/lose, make it best of a game of 5.
